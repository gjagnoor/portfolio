Editor allows new developers to create <span className="grey-highlight">HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</span> code snippets and see the results in real time.

Drive : Editor was built to give you an idea about my <span className="pink-highlight">technical knowledge [Front End]</span>. This project should also give you an idea about my <span className="pink-highlight">technical acumen</span>.

The Product Idea : The product idea was adopted from <span className="grey-highlight">CodePen</span>. It's missing some features, but I'll add them when I find time to work on this again.
