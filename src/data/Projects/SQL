The core motivation behind building this project was to showcase my research and experimentation skillset. It's based off of dummy but realistic enough data. I've added a markdown file that explains why I decided to pursue this problem and why I feel computational science should be the first step to deciding if a scientific research experiments should be conducted or not.

Development status : Not in Development

- This is low priority. I should focus on my portfolio for SWE interviews.
