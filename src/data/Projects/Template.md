A new type of starting template. Specifically for languages, libraries, technologies, and frameworks, I prefer to use in my personal projects.

Drive : To showcase how I prefer to <span className="pink-highlight">design my codebase</span>. I've added a .pdf file for this. I've also shared why I preferred specific technologies and languages for the working prototype.

Product Idea : Product idea was adopted from <span className="grey-highlight">Create-React-App</span>, <span className="grey-highlight">Express-generator</span>, and <span className="grey-highlight"> gatsby-starter-default </span>

Development status : Passive Development - unreleased.
