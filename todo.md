Things to do -

1. Add links to all `[enter link here]`
2. Create hyperlinks for all external links and github links
3. Update the resume on google drive
4. remove `design preference` from first set of bullets
5. Remove prototype design? - I should keep it for real life work. But it may not be beneficial enough for the resume. Since it doesn't portray core technical skills.
6. To give an idea about the breadth and depth of content I prefer welcome websites have. - fix the grammar

Pat on the back for myself - my portfolio is more performant now
